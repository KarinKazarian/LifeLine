<h2 id= "understanding"> Understanding the problem</h2>

Over the past couple years, our phones have devices have quickly become an extension of ourselves. We use it to capture memories by taking photos, we use it to communicate with our family who may live thousands of miles away, We use to order food when we’re hungry and to hail a ride when we need to get somewhere. It’s brought convenience to our lives but there are some negative impacts to this extend use of screens. It can affect you mentally and physically. 

The university of Gothenburg did a [study](https://www.recordgazette.net/screen-time-tied-to-health-issues/article_2d5aef9e-ddef-11e8-a22a-ebdc8aced172.html) where they found a link between heavy screen use to cause sleep disturbances. and
There have also been studies [linking screen media exposure to increased risks of obesity in children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5769928/)

Healthy screen habits has become a hot topic recently with many companies trying to promote it. Apple has implemented their own screen time services where you can see data on your screen use and set restrictions to help you control your use. There are also dedicated apps like forest that help you disconnect from your phone. 

We’re only going to become more dependent on our devices as time goes on, but if we could do everything we wanted and needed on a single application that promoted healthy screen habits then we could get all the benefits of our devices without having to deal with any of the negatives

### Impact of screen time on health

Several papers show that spending a lot of time in front of a computer combined with low physical activity is detrimental to one’s health and wellbeing.
Other papers show that sedentary behaviour itself (which is normally associated with screen time as the majority of people look at screens while sitting) is bad for your health independent of physical activity.

### Improving poor habits

The same research demonstrates the importance of clear, consistent and logical rules when it comes to screen time restrictions. It is simply infuriating for most people to lose functionality or access without knowing precisely why and what they should do about it when their screen time is restricted directly or indirectly.
Moreover, educational level, age and self-efficacy must be considered to devise appropriate solutions to reduce domestic screen time.

### Existing Super Apps

Looking at successful super apps, which were mostly developed and deployed in the East, we've found a few traits that make superapps attractive to its userbase.

**All features that a super app offers are consolidated**, the user does not need to download other apps, plugins, or extensions, the most commonly used features come pre-installed. All those features are made to be convenient and presented in an aesthetically similar format to guarantee the uniformity of the experience.

**Super app dashboards are as simple as possible** so it can achieve adoption as soon as possible. There should be minimal clutter, let the user navigate though submenus instead and then allow them to create shortcuts once they get used to using the app. There shouldn’t be clutter for accessibility reasons as well, as a super app should be appropriate for all ages.

**The app being more appealing is prioritized over profitability**, successful super apps don't have annoying ads, they don't obtain a lot of revenue per user, they seek to grow the userbase instead.

**The app stays out of the way of the user**, who should be able to do what they set out to do in minimal time. If the app recommends anything, it does so discreetly, it seizes control from the user rarely.

### Surveys

To better understand our potential user base, surveys were sent out to see what kinds of people would be willing to use a super app that promotes a healthy lifestyle and what they would expect from such an app and what they would want to use it for.

This survey also allowed us to learn more about the existing positive and negative habits of our potential users so that we can use this data to further guide us through the development and design of the app. Knowing what the respondents do with their devices and how it already affects their lives made it easier for us to decide what to include in the app.
